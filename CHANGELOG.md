# Changelog

**Why this file exists, and it is not bookkeeping.**

Measured 2026-09-06 by diffing each published `.crate` tarball against the tree —
a practice relayed by baracuda as *"keep the last release's consumer code and run
it against the new artifact; it answers what did this fix break, which no gate
written for the fix can ask."*

⚠️ **A public-API diff of `unpopped` 0.9.0 vs the tree reported PURELY ADDITIVE:
292 items → 293, nothing removed. Underneath were TWO behaviour changes in
`unpopped-vocab`, one of them NUMERIC — and both sat at a version number
IDENTICAL to the published one.** A signature diff cannot see a same-signature
behaviour change, and a version check cannot see a tree that never bumped.

## Unreleased

### `unpopped` — ⚠️ a BEHAVIOUR change, recorded the moment it landed

**Published 0.10.0 and the tree both say `0.10.0`. This must NOT ship as
`0.10.1`** — `^0.10.0` accepts a patch and this changes emitted contract text.
**Requires `0.11.0`.**

- **`ulp_bound` no longer declines an expression whose exactness is by
  construction.** An expression built entirely from `BinaryOp::is_int_only`
  operators — the bitwise and logical ops — has no rounding step on any
  hardware, so a non-CUDA target now gets `0.0` where it previously got
  `INFINITY`, and `precision_of` rates it `("correctly_rounded", Some(0))`
  instead of `("approximate", None)`.

  ⚠️ **The test is `is_int_only`, NOT `ulp_sum(e) == 0`.** `unary_ulp` rates
  `Sqrt`/`Recip`/`Floor` at 0.0 and `binary_ulp` rates
  `Copysign`/`Nextafter`/`FmaxIeee` at 0.0 — **those zeros are IEEE claims about
  a target's float unit**, exactly the borrowed assertion the namespace gate
  exists to refuse. Keying on the summed rating would re-admit every one of them,
  and a test asserts it does not.

  **Found by baracuda while adopting 0.10.0**, applying this repo's own rule: *a
  prescription that errs conservatively has no complainant.* A non-CUDA backend
  was getting a weaker contract than it could prove, emitting nothing wrong, and
  had nothing to file. **They saw it only because a signature change forced them
  to read the function.**

## Released

## 2026-09-06 — `unpopped-vocab 0.4.0` · `unpopped 0.10.0` · `unpopped-cpu-c 0.9.0` · `unpopped-slang 0.7.0`

⚠️ **Everything below shipped. It sat under "Unreleased" for forty minutes after
being published** — caught while adding the next entry, which is the only reason
it was caught at all. **A changelog whose "Unreleased" section describes released
work is worse than no changelog: it is the same object as a version number that
no longer matches its code, one level up.**

**Published and verified against the served tarballs; `unpopped-vocab 0.4.0` and
`unpopped 0.10.0` src trees are byte-identical to the merge commit.**

**Version cascade applied 2026-09-06 on the PM's ruling: `unpopped-vocab 0.4.0`,
never `0.3.3`.**

| crate | was | now | why it moved |
|---|---|---|---|
| `unpopped-vocab` | 0.3.2 | **0.4.0** | two behaviour changes, one numeric |
| `unpopped` | 0.9.0 | **0.10.0** | new public fn, a deprecation, and its vocab requirement moved |
| `unpopped-cpu-c` | 0.8.0 | **0.9.0** | ⚠️ **source BYTE-IDENTICAL to the published 0.8.0** — bumped ONLY because a dependency did |
| `unpopped-slang` | 0.6.0 | **0.7.0** | ⚠️ **source BYTE-IDENTICAL to the published 0.6.0** — bumped ONLY because a dependency did |
| `unpopped-conformance` | 0.1.0 | 0.1.0 | `publish = false`; not on the registry |

⚠️ **The two "byte-identical" rows are stated because a reader who sees a version
move with no behaviour change will otherwise assume there was one they cannot
find.** Both were verified by diffing the served `.crate` tarball against the
tree, not by inspection.

### Downstream, measured rather than reasoned

**Registry reverse-dependencies of `unpopped-vocab`: 6, all in this portfolio**
(control: `serde` returns 120,294, so the query works).

    baracuda-cuda-emit / -kernels-types / -types   require ^0.1.0  (an OLD line;
                                                    0.3.x never reached them)
    unpopped / unpopped-cpu-c / unpopped-slang     require ^0.3.2

⚠️ **And the hop that mattered was the one nobody had measured.** baracuda's
**working tree** declares `unpopped-vocab = "0.3.2"` **directly** — measured at
their `origin/main` `2b3292ca`, after fetching, because the local ref was stale.
**So the reassurance "baracuda is caret-pinned `^0.8.7` on `unpopped`, therefore
cannot reach the new vocab" was FALSE**: their direct vocab dependency would have
taken `0.3.3` on the next `cargo update`, bypassing the `unpopped` pin entirely.

**Their exposure to the numeric change is nonetheless zero, measured on their
side:** `Fp8E5M2::from_f32` has **0** call sites in baracuda. **`Fp8E4M3FN` is
unchanged by this release** — 0 diff lines between published 0.3.2 and the tree
mention E4M3, against a control of 5 mentioning E5M2 — so their two E4M3 call
sites are unaffected.


### `unpopped-vocab` 0.3.2 → 0.4.0 — the divergence that forced this release

**Two behaviour changes. Neither could ship as `0.3.3`.** The then-published
`unpopped 0.9.0` requires `unpopped-vocab = "0.3.2"`, a caret range that
**accepts 0.3.3** — so a patch bump reaches every existing consumer on their next
`cargo update`, with no compile error and no version signal.

- **`ElementKind` E5M2 `from_f32` overflow now produces INFINITY, not a saturated
  max-finite.** Overflow at `|x| >= 61440.0` (the midpoint between max-finite
  `57344` and `2^16`; the midpoint itself rounds to infinity, because
  ties-to-even picks the significand ending `00`) returns `sign | 0x7C`.
  Previously it delegated to `float8` 0.7.0, whose E5M2 encoder saturates **every**
  overflow to `0x7B` — including a literal `f32::INFINITY` — while **its own
  decoder maps `0x7C` to infinity**. ⚠️ **This is a NUMERIC change to emitted fp8
  bytes**: a value that encoded as `57344.0` now encodes as `inf`.
- **`winner_of` resolves an exact timing tie deterministically.** Previously
  `sort_by` stability made the winner, its `entry_point`, and the `margin` depend
  on the order the caller pushed candidates. The tiebreak is
  median → implementor code → entry point and carries **no** performance or
  preference meaning. ⚠️ **Emitted dispatch tables can differ for tied cells**,
  which is generated code a consumer has committed.

### `unpopped` 0.9.0 → 0.10.0

- **Added `ir::is_bit_move_row_reduce_output(stages, epilogue)`** — the
  §6.16-0011 classification for the `Access::RowReduce` shape, which had no
  helper at all. Purely additive.
- **Deprecated `ir::is_bit_move_reduce`** — it answers a fold question for shapes
  that may have several folds. Non-breaking; the two replacements have signatures
  that cannot be satisfied without the whole input→output path.
- **Corrected the `RowReduce` gating prescription in `ir.rs`'s field table.** The
  old advice classified an all-move multi-stage fold as *computed*. ⚠️ **It erred
  CONSERVATIVELY, so a consumer following it emitted pessimised-but-conforming
  code and had no symptom to report.**

### `unpopped-cpu-c` 0.8.0 → 0.9.0 · `unpopped-slang` 0.6.0 → 0.7.0

- **Published 0.8.0 source is IDENTICAL to the tree.** No bump needed on its own
  account; it moves only if its `unpopped` requirement does.

Versions at or before `unpopped 0.9.0` / `unpopped-cpu-c 0.8.0` /
`unpopped-vocab 0.3.2` predate this file. **Their contents were verified against
the served tarballs rather than reconstructed from memory**, which is the only
claim this file makes about them.
