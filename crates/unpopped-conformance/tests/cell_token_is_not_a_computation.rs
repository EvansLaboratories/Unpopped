//! A cell token names **what was asked for**. It cannot name **what runs**.
//!
//! `structure_key(op_category, operands, target)` takes no op body. Two
//! different computations of the same category, over the same operand shapes,
//! on the same target therefore derive the **same token** — by construction,
//! not by accident. That is the design: the token is a *schedule cell*, and a
//! schedule is chosen from shapes and dtypes, not from arithmetic.
//!
//! # Why this is measured here rather than argued from the signature
//!
//! "The body is not a parameter, therefore the token collides" is a correct
//! reading of a function signature and a *wrong* way to establish a property
//! that four other things depend on. The signature could grow a body term; a
//! backend could fold the body into the plan; the token codec could change. So
//! the collision is pinned as behaviour, with the separation that makes it
//! survivable pinned beside it — on **every** reference emitter, because this
//! is a claim about the standard and not about one backend.
//!
//! # What depends on it
//!
//! - **Caching** is safe: KISS-Synth §6.7-0004 requires a hit to match
//!   `(structure_key, revision_hash)`, and the revision hash is over the emitted
//!   source. Same cell, different arithmetic ⇒ different source ⇒ miss. Pinned
//!   below as the source-differs half.
//! - **Dispatch is not.** [`DispatchTable`] is keyed by the token *alone*:
//!   `from_entries`/`merge`/`normalize` keep one row per token, and `merge`
//!   treats a differing `winner_entry` as a competing schedule **variant** to
//!   be evicted on margin — not as a co-resident route. So a table that ever
//!   held two *computations* in one cell would benchmark them against each
//!   other and route both to whichever measured faster.
//!
//! That last one is a real precondition on the table's producer — *all
//! candidates in a cell compute the same thing* — which the type cannot check
//! and, until this file, nothing stated. The collapse is pinned below so the
//! precondition is executable rather than a sentence someone has to find.
