//! What this generator can actually **emit**, per dtype, per backend.
//!
//! # Why this is a test and not a line in a doc
//!
//! The deferred register carried these numbers in prose — "22/22 named, CpuC
//! lowers 9, Slang 5" — and by the time anyone read them they were wrong: the
//! measured figures are **8 and 4**. Not a large error, and that is the point.
//! A coverage claim decays silently, because nothing about adding or removing a
//! dtype arm forces the sentence describing it to change.
//!
//! So the claim lives here, as a table that has to be edited when the behaviour
//! moves. Adding a dtype to a backend fails this test until the table is
//! updated, which makes the update part of the change rather than a follow-up
//! nobody schedules.
//!
//! # Recognition is not lowering, and the gap is the useful number
//!
//! `unpopped-vocab` **recognizes** all 24 KISS §6.1 tokens and that is verified
//! against KISS's generated manifest. This file measures something different and
//! much smaller: for how many of those can this generator actually produce a
//! kernel. Conflating the two would let "we support 24 dtypes" mean two
//! incompatible things depending on who is asking — which is exactly the
//! distinction KISS draws between its recognition set and its usable set.
//!
//! A decline here is **conformant**, not a bug: a party that cannot lower a
//! dtype must still *name* it, so it can decline as a known dtype rather than as
//! an unknown token. This file pins which is which.

/// claiming support unconditionally emits `int8_t` for a target that cannot

/// cause also excluded a `vulkan:` vector from the cross-project byte-match;
/// that leg now reports 20/20 with zero capability exclusions.)
///
/// **Remaining — and it is NOT "no capability data". Asked the owner.**
///
/// This used to say the blocker was a missing machine-readable manifest (KISS
/// #171). Vulkane, who owns the `vulkan:` vocabulary under §6.8-0004, answered
/// directly and the real state is **asymmetric**:
///
/// * `i8`/`u8` — **answerable today.** The `<arith>` field carries `i8`, naming
///   `shaderInt8`. Declining these is over-refusal, and no manifest is needed.
/// * `i16`/`u16` — **the vocabulary cannot express it.** The published `<arith>`
///   names are exactly `dot8`, `f16`, `i8`, `st16`, `st8`; `shaderInt16` is not
///   among them. Vulkane records it as their gap; naming it later bumps the
///   vocabulary version rather than being additive.
///
/// And the trap they flagged hardest, recorded because it is the inference a
/// future reader would think obvious: **never derive 16-bit arithmetic from
/// `st16`.** That is `storageBuffer16BitAccess` — *storage*, not compute. A
/// device may take 16-bit data in a buffer and do the math in `f32`, so reading
/// it as permission to emit 16-bit integer arithmetic is a silently wrong
/// lowering on conformant hardware.
///
/// So the four stay `Blocked`, but for two different reasons, and the 8-bit

/// **An op-level refusal is now a MATCHABLE value naming the op it refused.**

/// test of its own because the previous shape — a `panic!` — was satisfiable by
/// any unrelated crash.
///
/// # The bar this had to clear
///
/// Baracuda's cross-backend suite asserts *"Slang declines `Copysign`"* by
/// inspecting a **panic payload**, precisely so an unrelated panic could not
/// satisfy it. The transition to a typed value had to make that discrimination
/// **stronger, not weaker** — otherwise their test would have degraded at exactly
/// the moment this API improved.
///
/// `matches!(d, Decline::UnsupportedOp { op: DeclinedOp::Binary(Copysign), .. })` is
/// structurally unsatisfiable by an unrelated failure, where a payload substring
/// is not. That is the bar cleared.
///
/// # Scope limit, stated because it changes what this test can prove
///
/// **That matchable form lives at the SEAM, and the seam is not reachable from
/// here.** An emitter builds its `Lowering` internally, so from outside the crate
/// the observable property is the weaker one: an op-level refusal is a **typed
/// `Err`** rather than a panic. That is what this test asserts, and it deliberately
/// checks the *variant* rather than only the message.
///
/// The stronger property is real but is exercised by a **backend author**, who
/// constructs the seam and matches on `Decline` directly — which is precisely
/// Baracuda's position. Asserting more than this from here would be claiming a
/// reach the test does not have.
///
/// # Why the decline is a success value
///
/// Note the shape: `Ok(Spelling::Declined(..))`, not `Err(..)`. Owed to Vulkane —
/// with a single error type, `let s = spell(..)?;` compiles, reads naturally, and
/// **silently converts a decline into a propagated failure**. Making a decline a
/// success value means `?` propagates only real failures and a decline *forces* a
/// match. The lazy path is the correct one, which matters because the lazy path is
/// the one that ships.
